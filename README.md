# Team HECK OHI/O
We're having a heck ton of fun here at [HACK OHI/O 2018](http://hack.osu.edu/2018/).  

# The project  
Large businesses and universities have WiFi access points everywhere. Can these be utilized to more intelligently turn on air conditioning and heating, leading to vast energy savings?

At [HACK OHI/O 2018](http://hack.osu.edu/2018/), we put together an application and physical model to showcase our answer to this question.

Our goal was to take advantage of vast wireless internet networks to create a smarter climate control solution. We accomplished this by combining network connection data of access points with temperature and proximity readings.

# What we built
Over the course of 24 hours, we developed a C# WinForms application and a physical demo of our idea.
