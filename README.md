# Team HECK OHI/O
We're having a heck ton of fun here at [HACK OHI/O 2018](http://hack.osu.edu/2018/).  

# The Project  
Large businesses and universities have WiFi access points everywhere. Can these be utilized to more intelligently turn on air conditioning and heating, leading to vast energy savings?

At HACK OHI/O 2018, we put together an applciation and physical model to showcase our solution.  
*Documentation is still being compiled.*
