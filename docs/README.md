Large businesses and universities have WiFi access points everywhere. Can these be utilized to more intelligently turn on air conditioning and heating, leading to vast energy savings?

At [HACK OHI/O 2018](http://hack.osu.edu/2018/), we put together an application and physical model to showcase our answer to this question.

Our goal was to take advantage of vast wireless internet networks to create a smarter climate control solution. We accomplished this by combining network connection data of access points with temperature and proximity readings.

### [**Jon Zimmerman**](https://github.com/Jon-Zimmerman)
Jon Zimmerman is a Mechanical Engineering student at Ohio State. Fun fact: He is a hardware hacking professional and hates being written about in README files.

### [**Michael Kaltman**](https://github.com/michaelskaltman)
Michael is a Biomedical Engineering student at the Ohio State University. He's thinking about what he wants this section to say. 

# What we built
Over the course of 24 hours, we developed a C# WinForms application and a physical demo of our idea.

*Documentation is still being compiled. Please bear with us.* ðŸ™‚
